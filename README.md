### **Intro** ###
#### **What is PWN** ####
PWN (Pronounced /pōn/ or pone), [formerly known as [CSI](https://github.com/0dayinc/csi)] is an open security automation framework that aims to stand on the shoulders of security giants, promoting trust and innovation.  Build your own custom automation drivers freely and easily using pre-built modules.  If a picture is worth a thousand words, imagine how many come to mind by watching this demo:

#### **Why PWN** ####
It's easy to agree that while corporate automation is a collection of proprietary source code, the core modules used to produce automated solutions should be open for all eyes to continuously promote trust and innovation...broad collaboration is key to any automation framework's success, particularly in the cyber security arena.


#### **How PWN Works** ####
Leveraging various pre-built modules and the pwn prototyper, you can mix-and-match modules to test, record, replay, and rollout your own custom security automation packages known as, "drivers."



#### **Installation** ####
Tested on Linux, & OSX leveraging Ruby via RVM.

```
$ gem install pwn
$ pwn
pwn[v0.4.351]:001 >>> PWN.help
```


### **General Usage** ###
[General Usage Quick-Start](https://github.com/0dayinc/pwn/wiki/General-PWN-Usage)

It's wise to update pwn often as numerous versions are released/week:
```
$ gem update pwn
$ pwn
pwn[v0.4.351]:001 >>> PWN.help
```


### **Call to Arms** ###
If you're willing to provide access to commercial security tools (e.g. Rapid7's Nexpose, Tenable Nessus, QualysGuard, HP WebInspect, IBM Appscan, etc) please PM us as this will continue to promote PWNs interoperability w/ industry-recognized security tools moving forward.  Additionally if you want to contribute to this framework's success, check out our [How to Contribute](https://github.com/0dayInc/pwn/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).


### **Module Documentation** ###
Additional documentation on using PWN can be found on [RubyGems.org](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/pwn)

I hope you enjoy PWN and remember...ensure you always have permission prior to carrying out any sort of hacktivities.  Now - go pwn all the things!

### **Keep Us Caffeinated** ###
