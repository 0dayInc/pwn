# CAPEC-173: Action Spoofing

- Catalog: [CAPEC-173](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/173.html)
- Abstraction: Meta · Status: Stable
- Likelihood of attack: High · Typical severity: Very High
- CAPEC list: 3.9

## Attack pattern

An adversary is able to disguise one action for another and therefore trick a user into initiating one type of action when they intend to initiate a different action. For example, a user might be led to believe that clicking a button will submit a query, but in fact it downloads software. Adversaries may perform this attack through social means, such as by simply convincing a victim to perform the action or relying on a user's natural inclination to do so, or through technical means, such as a clickjacking attack where a user sees one interface but is actually interacting with a second, invisible, interface.

## Exhaustive test law

This is a meta pattern. Do not stop at the name. Open every ChildOf / Has_Member descendant `references/CAPEC-<id>.md` and run those procedures. Exhaustion = every applicable child tested or N/A with evidence.

A scanner hit or a single blocked request is inventory, not a CAPEC-173 test. Complete means every in-scope instance finished the execution flow (or was ruled out with saved evidence) **and** every related CWE procedure was run or dated N/A.

## Tooling (PWN)

PWN::Plugins::Packet, extro_packet, PWN::Plugins::Tor; social-engineering skill, PWN::Plugins::MailAgent

## Procedure

1. **Applicability gate.** Check prerequisites and skills below. If the target cannot satisfy them, record `CAPEC-173 N/A: <reason>` and stop.
2. **Instance inventory.** List every actor/path/API/host where this pattern can run (anonymous, low-priv, high-priv, adjacent network, local). One URL is not an inventory.
3. **Oracle.** From consequences, define pass/fail (auth bypass, data out, crash, persistence, etc.).
4. **Execute the flow.** Run every Explore → Experiment → Exploit step and every listed technique. Persist request/response, pcap, or debugger output under `/tmp` or the engagement dir and **re-read** it.
5. **Mutate.** Encoding, method, role, content-type, timing, second-order, chained related CAPECs. Do not stop at the first WAF 403.
6. **Mitigation negation.** For each mitigation, retry the flow with the control on and bypassed. Unchanged oracle = control failed.
7. **CWE close-out.** Open each related `cwe` skill file (`../cwe/references/CWE-<id>.md`) and run that exhaustive CWE procedure. CAPEC without CWE is a technique note, not a weakness finding.
8. **Report.** Cite `CAPEC-173`, related CWE IDs, instance, oracle, evidence path.

## Execution flow (minimum techniques)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Prerequisites

- The adversary must convince the victim into performing the decoy action.
- The adversary must have the means to control a user's interface to present them with a decoy action as well as the actual malicious action. Simple versions of this attack can be performed using web pages requiring only that the adversary be able to host (or control) content that the user visits.

## Skills required

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Resources required

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Oracles (consequences)

- Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability: Other — Action spoofing can result in a wide variety of consequences and negatively affect all three elements of the security triad.

## Mitigations to bypass

- Avoid interacting with suspicious sites or clicking suspicious links.
- An organization should provide regular, robust cybersecurity training to its employees.

## Example instances (payload / topology hints)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Related CAPECs (test these too)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Related CWEs (run the cwe skill)

- [CWE-451](../cwe/references/CWE-451.md) — run that CWE procedure after this CAPEC flow

## Verification

- [ ] Applicability recorded (in-scope or dated N/A)
- [ ] Instance inventory is more than one guess
- [ ] Every execution-flow step was attempted or marked N/A
- [ ] Evidence artifact path saved and re-read
- [ ] Related CAPECs handled or deferred
- [ ] Related CWE procedures run via `cwe` skill
- [ ] Finding (if any) cites CAPEC-173 and CWE IDs
