# CAPEC-472: Browser Fingerprinting

- Catalog: [CAPEC-472](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/472.html)
- Abstraction: Detailed · Status: Draft
- Likelihood of attack: not stated · Typical severity: Low
- CAPEC list: 3.9

## Attack pattern

An attacker carefully crafts small snippets of Java Script to efficiently detect the type of browser the potential victim is using. Many web-based attacks need prior knowledge of the web browser including the version of browser to ensure successful exploitation of a vulnerability. Having this knowledge allows an attacker to target the victim with attacks that specifically exploit known or zero day weaknesses in the type and version of the browser used by the victim. Automating this process via Java Script as a part of the same delivery system used to exploit the browser is considered more efficient as the attacker can supply a browser fingerprinting method and integrate it with exploit code, all contained in Java Script and in response to the same web page request by the browser.

## Exhaustive test law

This is a detailed pattern. Execute every listed technique in the execution flow, then mutate encodings/roles/verbs. Also run the parent Standard/Meta patterns.

A scanner hit or a single blocked request is inventory, not a CAPEC-472 test. Complete means every in-scope instance finished the execution flow (or was ruled out with saved evidence) **and** every related CWE procedure was run or dated N/A.

## Tooling (PWN)

skills_recall capec → read references/CAPEC-<id>.md; then skills_recall cwe for each related CWE; pwn_eval / BurpSuite / TransparentBrowser / SAST as the surface requires

## Procedure

1. **Applicability gate.** Check prerequisites and skills below. If the target cannot satisfy them, record `CAPEC-472 N/A: <reason>` and stop.
2. **Instance inventory.** List every actor/path/API/host where this pattern can run (anonymous, low-priv, high-priv, adjacent network, local). One URL is not an inventory.
3. **Oracle.** From consequences, define pass/fail (auth bypass, data out, crash, persistence, etc.).
4. **Execute the flow.** Run every Explore → Experiment → Exploit step and every listed technique. Persist request/response, pcap, or debugger output under `/tmp` or the engagement dir and **re-read** it.
5. **Mutate.** Encoding, method, role, content-type, timing, second-order, chained related CAPECs. Do not stop at the first WAF 403.
6. **Mitigation negation.** For each mitigation, retry the flow with the control on and bypassed. Unchanged oracle = control failed.
7. **CWE close-out.** Open each related `cwe` skill file (`../cwe/references/CWE-<id>.md`) and run that exhaustive CWE procedure. CAPEC without CWE is a technique note, not a weakness finding.
8. **Report.** Cite `CAPEC-472`, related CWE IDs, instance, oracle, evidence path.

## Execution flow (minimum techniques)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Prerequisites

- Victim's browser visits a website that contains attacker's Java ScriptJava Script is not disabled in the victim's browser

## Skills required

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Resources required

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Oracles (consequences)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Mitigations to bypass

- Configuration: Disable Java Script in the browser

## Example instances (payload / topology hints)

- The following code snippets can be used to detect various browsers: Firefox 2/3 FF=/a/[-1]=='a' Firefox 3 FF3=(function x(){})[-5]=='x' Firefox 2 FF2=(function x(){})[-6]=='x' IE IE='\v'=='v' Safari Saf=/a/.__proto__=='//' Chrome Chr=/source/.test((/a/.toString+'')) Opera Op=/^function \(/.test([].sort)

## Related CAPECs (test these too)

- ChildOf → [CAPEC-541](CAPEC-541.md)

## Related CWEs (run the cwe skill)

- [CWE-200](../cwe/references/CWE-200.md) — run that CWE procedure after this CAPEC flow

## Verification

- [ ] Applicability recorded (in-scope or dated N/A)
- [ ] Instance inventory is more than one guess
- [ ] Every execution-flow step was attempted or marked N/A
- [ ] Evidence artifact path saved and re-read
- [ ] Related CAPECs handled or deferred
- [ ] Related CWE procedures run via `cwe` skill
- [ ] Finding (if any) cites CAPEC-472 and CWE IDs
