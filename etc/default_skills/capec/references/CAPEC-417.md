# CAPEC-417: Influence Perception

- Catalog: [CAPEC-417](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/417.html)
- Abstraction: Standard · Status: Stable
- Likelihood of attack: High · Typical severity: Low
- CAPEC list: 3.9

## Attack pattern

The adversary uses social engineering to exploit the target's perception of the relationship between the adversary and themselves. This goal is to persuade the target to unknowingly perform an action or divulge information that is advantageous to the adversary.

## Exhaustive test law

This is a standard pattern. Inventory every place the execution flow can apply, then run every Explore/Experiment/Exploit step against each instance. One successful probe is not exhaustion.

A scanner hit or a single blocked request is inventory, not a CAPEC-417 test. Complete means every in-scope instance finished the execution flow (or was ruled out with saved evidence) **and** every related CWE procedure was run or dated N/A.

## Tooling (PWN)

social-engineering skill, PWN::Plugins::MailAgent

## Procedure

1. **Applicability gate.** Check prerequisites and skills below. If the target cannot satisfy them, record `CAPEC-417 N/A: <reason>` and stop.
2. **Instance inventory.** List every actor/path/API/host where this pattern can run (anonymous, low-priv, high-priv, adjacent network, local). One URL is not an inventory.
3. **Oracle.** From consequences, define pass/fail (auth bypass, data out, crash, persistence, etc.).
4. **Execute the flow.** Run every Explore → Experiment → Exploit step and every listed technique. Persist request/response, pcap, or debugger output under `/tmp` or the engagement dir and **re-read** it.
5. **Mutate.** Encoding, method, role, content-type, timing, second-order, chained related CAPECs. Do not stop at the first WAF 403.
6. **Mitigation negation.** For each mitigation, retry the flow with the control on and bypassed. Unchanged oracle = control failed.
7. **CWE close-out.** Open each related `cwe` skill file (`../cwe/references/CWE-<id>.md`) and run that exhaustive CWE procedure. CAPEC without CWE is a technique note, not a weakness finding.
8. **Report.** Cite `CAPEC-417`, related CWE IDs, instance, oracle, evidence path.

## Execution flow (minimum techniques)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Prerequisites

- The adversary must have the means and knowledge of how to communicate with the target in some manner.

## Skills required

- Low: The adversary requires strong inter-personal and communication skills.

## Resources required

- There are no necessary resources required for this attack.

## Oracles (consequences)

- Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability: Other — Attacks that influence the perception of the target can result in a wide variety of consequences and negatively affect potentially the confidentiality, availability, and/or integrity of an application or system.

## Mitigations to bypass

- An organization should provide regular, robust cybersecurity training to its employees to prevent social engineering attacks.

## Example instances (payload / topology hints)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Related CAPECs (test these too)

- ChildOf → [CAPEC-416](CAPEC-416.md)

## Related CWEs (run the cwe skill)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Verification

- [ ] Applicability recorded (in-scope or dated N/A)
- [ ] Instance inventory is more than one guess
- [ ] Every execution-flow step was attempted or marked N/A
- [ ] Evidence artifact path saved and re-read
- [ ] Related CAPECs handled or deferred
- [ ] Related CWE procedures run via `cwe` skill
- [ ] Finding (if any) cites CAPEC-417 and CWE IDs
