# CAPEC-482: TCP Flood

- Catalog: [CAPEC-482](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/482.html)
- Abstraction: Standard · Status: Draft
- Likelihood of attack: not stated · Typical severity: not stated
- CAPEC list: 3.9

## Attack pattern

An adversary may execute a flooding attack using the TCP protocol with the intent to deny legitimate users access to a service. These attacks exploit the weakness within the TCP protocol where there is some state information for the connection the server needs to maintain. This often involves the use of TCP SYN messages.

## Exhaustive test law

This is a standard pattern. Inventory every place the execution flow can apply, then run every Explore/Experiment/Exploit step against each instance. One successful probe is not exhaustion.

A scanner hit or a single blocked request is inventory, not a CAPEC-482 test. Complete means every in-scope instance finished the execution flow (or was ruled out with saved evidence) **and** every related CWE procedure was run or dated N/A.

## Tooling (PWN)

skills_recall capec → read references/CAPEC-<id>.md; then skills_recall cwe for each related CWE; pwn_eval / BurpSuite / TransparentBrowser / SAST as the surface requires

## Procedure

1. **Applicability gate.** Check prerequisites and skills below. If the target cannot satisfy them, record `CAPEC-482 N/A: <reason>` and stop.
2. **Instance inventory.** List every actor/path/API/host where this pattern can run (anonymous, low-priv, high-priv, adjacent network, local). One URL is not an inventory.
3. **Oracle.** From consequences, define pass/fail (auth bypass, data out, crash, persistence, etc.).
4. **Execute the flow.** Run every Explore → Experiment → Exploit step and every listed technique. Persist request/response, pcap, or debugger output under `/tmp` or the engagement dir and **re-read** it.
5. **Mutate.** Encoding, method, role, content-type, timing, second-order, chained related CAPECs. Do not stop at the first WAF 403.
6. **Mitigation negation.** For each mitigation, retry the flow with the control on and bypassed. Unchanged oracle = control failed.
7. **CWE close-out.** Open each related `cwe` skill file (`../cwe/references/CWE-<id>.md`) and run that exhaustive CWE procedure. CAPEC without CWE is a technique note, not a weakness finding.
8. **Report.** Cite `CAPEC-482`, related CWE IDs, instance, oracle, evidence path.

## Execution flow (minimum techniques)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Prerequisites

- This type of an attack requires the ability to generate a large amount of TCP traffic to send to the target port of a functioning server.

## Skills required

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Resources required

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Oracles (consequences)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Mitigations to bypass

- To mitigate this type of an attack, an organization can monitor incoming packets and look for patterns in the TCP traffic to determine if the network is under an attack. The potential target may implement a rate limit on TCP SYN messages which would provide limited capabilities while under attack.

## Example instances (payload / topology hints)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Related CAPECs (test these too)

- ChildOf → [CAPEC-125](CAPEC-125.md)

## Related CWEs (run the cwe skill)

- [CWE-770](../cwe/references/CWE-770.md) — run that CWE procedure after this CAPEC flow

## Verification

- [ ] Applicability recorded (in-scope or dated N/A)
- [ ] Instance inventory is more than one guess
- [ ] Every execution-flow step was attempted or marked N/A
- [ ] Evidence artifact path saved and re-read
- [ ] Related CAPECs handled or deferred
- [ ] Related CWE procedures run via `cwe` skill
- [ ] Finding (if any) cites CAPEC-482 and CWE IDs
