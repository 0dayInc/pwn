# CAPEC-148: Content Spoofing

- Catalog: [CAPEC-148](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/148.html)
- Abstraction: Meta · Status: Stable
- Likelihood of attack: Medium · Typical severity: Medium
- CAPEC list: 3.9

## Attack pattern

An adversary modifies content to make it contain something other than what the original content producer intended while keeping the apparent source of the content unchanged. The term content spoofing is most often used to describe modification of web pages hosted by a target to display the adversary's content instead of the owner's content. However, any content can be spoofed, including the content of email messages, file transfers, or the content of other network communication protocols. Content can be modified at the source (e.g. modifying the source file for a web page) or in transit (e.g. intercepting and modifying a message between the sender and recipient). Usually, the adversary will attempt to hide the fact that the content has been modified, but in some cases, such as with web site defacement, this is not necessary. Content Spoofing can lead to malware exposure, financial fraud (if the content governs financial transactions), privacy violations, and other unwanted outcomes.

## Exhaustive test law

This is a meta pattern. Do not stop at the name. Open every ChildOf / Has_Member descendant `references/CAPEC-<id>.md` and run those procedures. Exhaustion = every applicable child tested or N/A with evidence.

A scanner hit or a single blocked request is inventory, not a CAPEC-148 test. Complete means every in-scope instance finished the execution flow (or was ruled out with saved evidence) **and** every related CWE procedure was run or dated N/A.

## Tooling (PWN)

PWN::Plugins::Packet, extro_packet, PWN::Plugins::Tor

## Procedure

1. **Applicability gate.** Check prerequisites and skills below. If the target cannot satisfy them, record `CAPEC-148 N/A: <reason>` and stop.
2. **Instance inventory.** List every actor/path/API/host where this pattern can run (anonymous, low-priv, high-priv, adjacent network, local). One URL is not an inventory.
3. **Oracle.** From consequences, define pass/fail (auth bypass, data out, crash, persistence, etc.).
4. **Execute the flow.** Run every Explore → Experiment → Exploit step and every listed technique. Persist request/response, pcap, or debugger output under `/tmp` or the engagement dir and **re-read** it.
5. **Mutate.** Encoding, method, role, content-type, timing, second-order, chained related CAPECs. Do not stop at the first WAF 403.
6. **Mitigation negation.** For each mitigation, retry the flow with the control on and bypassed. Unchanged oracle = control failed.
7. **CWE close-out.** Open each related `cwe` skill file (`../cwe/references/CWE-<id>.md`) and run that exhaustive CWE procedure. CAPEC without CWE is a technique note, not a weakness finding.
8. **Report.** Cite `CAPEC-148`, related CWE IDs, instance, oracle, evidence path.

## Execution flow (minimum techniques)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Prerequisites

- The target must provide content but fail to adequately protect it against modification.The adversary must have the means to alter data to which they are not authorized. If the content is to be modified in transit, the adversary must be able to intercept the targeted messages.

## Skills required

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Resources required

- If the content is to be modified in transit, the adversary requires a tool capable of intercepting the target's communication and generating/creating custom packets to impact the communications. In some variants, the targeted content is altered so that all or some of it is redirected towards content published by the attacker (for example, images and frames in the target's web site might be modifi…

## Oracles (consequences)

- Integrity: Modify Data — A successful content spoofing attack compromises the integrity of the application data.

## Mitigations to bypass

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Example instances (payload / topology hints)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Related CAPECs (test these too)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Related CWEs (run the cwe skill)

- [CWE-345](../cwe/references/CWE-345.md) — run that CWE procedure after this CAPEC flow

## Verification

- [ ] Applicability recorded (in-scope or dated N/A)
- [ ] Instance inventory is more than one guess
- [ ] Every execution-flow step was attempted or marked N/A
- [ ] Evidence artifact path saved and re-read
- [ ] Related CAPECs handled or deferred
- [ ] Related CWE procedures run via `cwe` skill
- [ ] Finding (if any) cites CAPEC-148 and CWE IDs
