# CAPEC-195: Principal Spoof

- Catalog: [CAPEC-195](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/195.html)
- Abstraction: Standard · Status: Draft
- Likelihood of attack: not stated · Typical severity: Medium
- CAPEC list: 3.9

## Attack pattern

A Principal Spoof is a form of Identity Spoofing where an adversary pretends to be some other person in an interaction. This is often accomplished by crafting a message (either written, verbal, or visual) that appears to come from a person other than the adversary. Phishing and Pharming attacks often attempt to do this so that their attempts to gather sensitive information appear to come from a legitimate source. A Principal Spoof does not use stolen or spoofed authentication credentials, instead relying on the appearance and content of the message to reflect identity.

## Exhaustive test law

This is a standard pattern. Inventory every place the execution flow can apply, then run every Explore/Experiment/Exploit step against each instance. One successful probe is not exhaustion.

A scanner hit or a single blocked request is inventory, not a CAPEC-195 test. Complete means every in-scope instance finished the execution flow (or was ruled out with saved evidence) **and** every related CWE procedure was run or dated N/A.

## Tooling (PWN)

PWN::Plugins::Fuzz, PWN::Plugins::AuthenticationHelper, hydra/ncrack via shell; PWN::Plugins::Packet, extro_packet, PWN::Plugins::Tor; social-engineering skill, PWN::Plugins::MailAgent; PWN::Bounty::LifecycleAuthzReplay, PWN::Plugins::BurpSuite

## Procedure

1. **Applicability gate.** Check prerequisites and skills below. If the target cannot satisfy them, record `CAPEC-195 N/A: <reason>` and stop.
2. **Instance inventory.** List every actor/path/API/host where this pattern can run (anonymous, low-priv, high-priv, adjacent network, local). One URL is not an inventory.
3. **Oracle.** From consequences, define pass/fail (auth bypass, data out, crash, persistence, etc.).
4. **Execute the flow.** Run every Explore → Experiment → Exploit step and every listed technique. Persist request/response, pcap, or debugger output under `/tmp` or the engagement dir and **re-read** it.
5. **Mutate.** Encoding, method, role, content-type, timing, second-order, chained related CAPECs. Do not stop at the first WAF 403.
6. **Mitigation negation.** For each mitigation, retry the flow with the control on and bypassed. Unchanged oracle = control failed.
7. **CWE close-out.** Open each related `cwe` skill file (`../cwe/references/CWE-<id>.md`) and run that exhaustive CWE procedure. CAPEC without CWE is a technique note, not a weakness finding.
8. **Report.** Cite `CAPEC-195`, related CWE IDs, instance, oracle, evidence path.

## Execution flow (minimum techniques)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Prerequisites

- The target must associate data or activities with a person's identity and the adversary must be able to modify this identity without detection.

## Skills required

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Resources required

- None: No specialized resources are required to execute this type of attack.

## Oracles (consequences)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Mitigations to bypass

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Example instances (payload / topology hints)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Related CAPECs (test these too)

- ChildOf → [CAPEC-151](CAPEC-151.md)

## Related CWEs (run the cwe skill)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Verification

- [ ] Applicability recorded (in-scope or dated N/A)
- [ ] Instance inventory is more than one guess
- [ ] Every execution-flow step was attempted or marked N/A
- [ ] Evidence artifact path saved and re-read
- [ ] Related CAPECs handled or deferred
- [ ] Related CWE procedures run via `cwe` skill
- [ ] Finding (if any) cites CAPEC-195 and CWE IDs
