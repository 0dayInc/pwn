# CAPEC-190: Reverse Engineer an Executable to Expose Assumed Hidden Functionality

- Catalog: [CAPEC-190](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)
- Abstraction: Detailed · Status: Draft
- Likelihood of attack: not stated · Typical severity: Low
- CAPEC list: 3.9

## Attack pattern

An attacker analyzes a binary file or executable for the purpose of discovering the structure, function, and possibly source-code of the file by using a variety of analysis techniques to effectively determine how the software functions and operates. This type of analysis is also referred to as Reverse Code Engineering, as techniques exist for extracting source code from an executable. Several techniques are often employed for this purpose, both black box and white box. The use of computer bus analyzers and packet sniffers allows the binary to be studied at a level of interactions with its computing environment, such as a host OS, inter-process communication, and/or network communication. This type of analysis falls into the 'black box' category because it involves behavioral analysis of the software without reference to source code, object code, or protocol specifications.

## Exhaustive test law

This is a detailed pattern. Execute every listed technique in the execution flow, then mutate encodings/roles/verbs. Also run the parent Standard/Meta patterns.

A scanner hit or a single blocked request is inventory, not a CAPEC-190 test. Complete means every in-scope instance finished the execution flow (or was ruled out with saved evidence) **and** every related CWE procedure was run or dated N/A.

## Tooling (PWN)

PWN::Plugins::Packet, extro_packet, PWN::Plugins::Tor

## Procedure

1. **Applicability gate.** Check prerequisites and skills below. If the target cannot satisfy them, record `CAPEC-190 N/A: <reason>` and stop.
2. **Instance inventory.** List every actor/path/API/host where this pattern can run (anonymous, low-priv, high-priv, adjacent network, local). One URL is not an inventory.
3. **Oracle.** From consequences, define pass/fail (auth bypass, data out, crash, persistence, etc.).
4. **Execute the flow.** Run every Explore → Experiment → Exploit step and every listed technique. Persist request/response, pcap, or debugger output under `/tmp` or the engagement dir and **re-read** it.
5. **Mutate.** Encoding, method, role, content-type, timing, second-order, chained related CAPECs. Do not stop at the first WAF 403.
6. **Mitigation negation.** For each mitigation, retry the flow with the control on and bypassed. Unchanged oracle = control failed.
7. **CWE close-out.** Open each related `cwe` skill file (`../cwe/references/CWE-<id>.md`) and run that exhaustive CWE procedure. CAPEC without CWE is a technique note, not a weakness finding.
8. **Report.** Cite `CAPEC-190`, related CWE IDs, instance, oracle, evidence path.

## Related CAPECs (test these too)

- ChildOf → [CAPEC-167](CAPEC-167.md)

## Related CWEs (run the cwe skill)

- [CWE-912](../cwe/references/CWE-912.md) — run that CWE procedure after this CAPEC flow

## Verification

- [ ] Applicability recorded (in-scope or dated N/A)
- [ ] Instance inventory is more than one guess
- [ ] Every execution-flow step was attempted or marked N/A
- [ ] Evidence artifact path saved and re-read
- [ ] Related CAPECs handled or deferred
- [ ] Related CWE procedures run via `cwe` skill
- [ ] Finding (if any) cites CAPEC-190 and CWE IDs
