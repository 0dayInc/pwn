# CAPEC-502: Intent Spoof

- Catalog: [CAPEC-502](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)
- Abstraction: Standard · Status: Draft
- Likelihood of attack: not stated · Typical severity: not stated
- CAPEC list: 3.9

## Attack pattern

An adversary, through a previously installed malicious application, issues an intent directed toward a specific trusted application's component in an attempt to achieve a variety of different objectives including modification of data, information disclosure, and data injection. Components that have been unintentionally exported and made public are subject to this type of an attack. If the component trusts the intent's action without verififcation, then the target application performs the functionality at the adversary's request, helping the adversary achieve the desired negative technical impact.

## Exhaustive test law

This is a standard pattern. Inventory every place the execution flow can apply, then run every Explore/Experiment/Exploit step against each instance. One successful probe is not exhaustion.

A scanner hit or a single blocked request is inventory, not a CAPEC-502 test. Complete means every in-scope instance finished the execution flow (or was ruled out with saved evidence) **and** every related CWE procedure was run or dated N/A.

## Tooling (PWN)

PWN::Plugins::Packet, extro_packet, PWN::Plugins::Tor

## Procedure

1. **Applicability gate.** Check prerequisites and skills below. If the target cannot satisfy them, record `CAPEC-502 N/A: <reason>` and stop.
2. **Instance inventory.** List every actor/path/API/host where this pattern can run (anonymous, low-priv, high-priv, adjacent network, local). One URL is not an inventory.
3. **Oracle.** From consequences, define pass/fail (auth bypass, data out, crash, persistence, etc.).
4. **Execute the flow.** Run every Explore → Experiment → Exploit step and every listed technique. Persist request/response, pcap, or debugger output under `/tmp` or the engagement dir and **re-read** it.
5. **Mutate.** Encoding, method, role, content-type, timing, second-order, chained related CAPECs. Do not stop at the first WAF 403.
6. **Mitigation negation.** For each mitigation, retry the flow with the control on and bypassed. Unchanged oracle = control failed.
7. **CWE close-out.** Open each related `cwe` skill file (`../cwe/references/CWE-<id>.md`) and run that exhaustive CWE procedure. CAPEC without CWE is a technique note, not a weakness finding.
8. **Report.** Cite `CAPEC-502`, related CWE IDs, instance, oracle, evidence path.

## Execution flow (minimum techniques)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Prerequisites

- An adversary must be able install a purpose built malicious application onto the Android device and convince the user to execute it. The malicious application will be used to issue spoofed intents.

## Skills required

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Resources required

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Oracles (consequences)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Mitigations to bypass

- To limit one's exposure to this type of attack, developers should avoid exporting components unless the component is specifically designed to handle requests from untrusted applications. Developers should be aware that declaring an intent filter will automatically export the component, exposing it to public access. Critical, state-changing actions should not be placed in exported components. If a…

## Example instances (payload / topology hints)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Related CAPECs (test these too)

- ChildOf → [CAPEC-148](CAPEC-148.md)

## Related CWEs (run the cwe skill)

- [CWE-284](../cwe/references/CWE-284.md) — run that CWE procedure after this CAPEC flow

## Verification

- [ ] Applicability recorded (in-scope or dated N/A)
- [ ] Instance inventory is more than one guess
- [ ] Every execution-flow step was attempted or marked N/A
- [ ] Evidence artifact path saved and re-read
- [ ] Related CAPECs handled or deferred
- [ ] Related CWE procedures run via `cwe` skill
- [ ] Finding (if any) cites CAPEC-502 and CWE IDs
