# CAPEC-161: Infrastructure Manipulation

- Catalog: [CAPEC-161](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/161.html)
- Abstraction: Meta · Status: Draft
- Likelihood of attack: not stated · Typical severity: High
- CAPEC list: 3.9

## Attack pattern

An attacker exploits characteristics of the infrastructure of a network entity in order to perpetrate attacks or information gathering on network objects or effect a change in the ordinary information flow between network objects. Most often, this involves manipulation of the routing of network messages so, instead of arriving at their proper destination, they are directed towards an entity of the attackers' choosing, usually a server controlled by the attacker. The victim is often unaware that their messages are not being processed correctly. For example, a targeted client may believe they are connecting to their own bank but, in fact, be connecting to a Pharming site controlled by the attacker which then collects the user's login information in order to hijack the actual bank account.

## Exhaustive test law

This is a meta pattern. Do not stop at the name. Open every ChildOf / Has_Member descendant `references/CAPEC-<id>.md` and run those procedures. Exhaustion = every applicable child tested or N/A with evidence.

A scanner hit or a single blocked request is inventory, not a CAPEC-161 test. Complete means every in-scope instance finished the execution flow (or was ruled out with saved evidence) **and** every related CWE procedure was run or dated N/A.

## Tooling (PWN)

skills_recall capec → read references/CAPEC-<id>.md; then skills_recall cwe for each related CWE; pwn_eval / BurpSuite / TransparentBrowser / SAST as the surface requires

## Procedure

1. **Applicability gate.** Check prerequisites and skills below. If the target cannot satisfy them, record `CAPEC-161 N/A: <reason>` and stop.
2. **Instance inventory.** List every actor/path/API/host where this pattern can run (anonymous, low-priv, high-priv, adjacent network, local). One URL is not an inventory.
3. **Oracle.** From consequences, define pass/fail (auth bypass, data out, crash, persistence, etc.).
4. **Execute the flow.** Run every Explore → Experiment → Exploit step and every listed technique. Persist request/response, pcap, or debugger output under `/tmp` or the engagement dir and **re-read** it.
5. **Mutate.** Encoding, method, role, content-type, timing, second-order, chained related CAPECs. Do not stop at the first WAF 403.
6. **Mitigation negation.** For each mitigation, retry the flow with the control on and bypassed. Unchanged oracle = control failed.
7. **CWE close-out.** Open each related `cwe` skill file (`../cwe/references/CWE-<id>.md`) and run that exhaustive CWE procedure. CAPEC without CWE is a technique note, not a weakness finding.
8. **Report.** Cite `CAPEC-161`, related CWE IDs, instance, oracle, evidence path.

## Execution flow (minimum techniques)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Prerequisites

- The targeted client must access the site via infrastructure that the attacker has co-opted and must fail to adequately verify that the communication channel is operating correctly (e.g. by verifying that they are, in fact, connected to the site they intended.)

## Skills required

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Resources required

- The attacker must be able to corrupt the infrastructure used by the client. For some variants of this attack, the attacker must be able to stand up their own services that mimic the services the targeted client intends to use.

## Oracles (consequences)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Mitigations to bypass

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Example instances (payload / topology hints)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Related CAPECs (test these too)

- CanPrecede → [CAPEC-664](CAPEC-664.md)

## Related CWEs (run the cwe skill)

- [CWE-923](../cwe/references/CWE-923.md) — run that CWE procedure after this CAPEC flow

## Verification

- [ ] Applicability recorded (in-scope or dated N/A)
- [ ] Instance inventory is more than one guess
- [ ] Every execution-flow step was attempted or marked N/A
- [ ] Evidence artifact path saved and re-read
- [ ] Related CAPECs handled or deferred
- [ ] Related CWE procedures run via `cwe` skill
- [ ] Finding (if any) cites CAPEC-161 and CWE IDs
