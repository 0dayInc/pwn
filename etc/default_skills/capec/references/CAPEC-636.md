# CAPEC-636: Hiding Malicious Data or Code within Files

- Catalog: [CAPEC-636](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/636.html)
- Abstraction: Standard · Status: Draft
- Likelihood of attack: not stated · Typical severity: High
- CAPEC list: 3.9

## Attack pattern

Files on various operating systems can have a complex format which allows for the storage of other data, in addition to its contents. Often this is metadata about the file, such as a cached thumbnail for an image file. Unless utilities are invoked in a particular way, this data is not visible during the normal use of the file. It is possible for an attacker to store malicious data or code using these facilities, which would be difficult to discover.

## Exhaustive test law

This is a standard pattern. Inventory every place the execution flow can apply, then run every Explore/Experiment/Exploit step against each instance. One successful probe is not exhaustion.

A scanner hit or a single blocked request is inventory, not a CAPEC-636 test. Complete means every in-scope instance finished the execution flow (or was ruled out with saved evidence) **and** every related CWE procedure was run or dated N/A.

## Tooling (PWN)

skills_recall capec → read references/CAPEC-<id>.md; then skills_recall cwe for each related CWE; pwn_eval / BurpSuite / TransparentBrowser / SAST as the surface requires

## Procedure

1. **Applicability gate.** Check prerequisites and skills below. If the target cannot satisfy them, record `CAPEC-636 N/A: <reason>` and stop.
2. **Instance inventory.** List every actor/path/API/host where this pattern can run (anonymous, low-priv, high-priv, adjacent network, local). One URL is not an inventory.
3. **Oracle.** From consequences, define pass/fail (auth bypass, data out, crash, persistence, etc.).
4. **Execute the flow.** Run every Explore → Experiment → Exploit step and every listed technique. Persist request/response, pcap, or debugger output under `/tmp` or the engagement dir and **re-read** it.
5. **Mutate.** Encoding, method, role, content-type, timing, second-order, chained related CAPECs. Do not stop at the first WAF 403.
6. **Mitigation negation.** For each mitigation, retry the flow with the control on and bypassed. Unchanged oracle = control failed.
7. **CWE close-out.** Open each related `cwe` skill file (`../cwe/references/CWE-<id>.md`) and run that exhaustive CWE procedure. CAPEC without CWE is a technique note, not a weakness finding.
8. **Report.** Cite `CAPEC-636`, related CWE IDs, instance, oracle, evidence path.

## Execution flow (minimum techniques)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Prerequisites

- The operating system must support a file system that allows for alternate data storage for a file.

## Skills required

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Resources required

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Oracles (consequences)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Mitigations to bypass

- Many tools are available to search for the hidden data. Scan regularly for such data using one of these tools.

## Example instances (payload / topology hints)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Related CAPECs (test these too)

- ChildOf → [CAPEC-165](CAPEC-165.md)

## Related CWEs (run the cwe skill)

- [CWE-506](../cwe/references/CWE-506.md) — run that CWE procedure after this CAPEC flow

## Verification

- [ ] Applicability recorded (in-scope or dated N/A)
- [ ] Instance inventory is more than one guess
- [ ] Every execution-flow step was attempted or marked N/A
- [ ] Evidence artifact path saved and re-read
- [ ] Related CAPECs handled or deferred
- [ ] Related CWE procedures run via `cwe` skill
- [ ] Finding (if any) cites CAPEC-636 and CWE IDs
