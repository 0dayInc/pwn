# CAPEC-288: DEPRECATED: ICMP Echo Request Ping


**Deprecated/Obsolete in CAPEC catalog.** Still execute the flow if the target exhibits it; prefer ChildOf/CanFollow replacements.

- Catalog: [CAPEC-288](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/288.html)
- Abstraction: Meta · Status: Deprecated
- Likelihood of attack: not stated · Typical severity: Low
- CAPEC list: 3.9

## Attack pattern

This attack pattern has been deprecated as it is a duplicate of the existing attack pattern "CAPEC-285". Please refer to this other CAPEC going forward.

## Exhaustive test law

This is a meta pattern. Do not stop at the name. Open every ChildOf / Has_Member descendant `references/CAPEC-<id>.md` and run those procedures. Exhaustion = every applicable child tested or N/A with evidence.

A scanner hit or a single blocked request is inventory, not a CAPEC-288 test. Complete means every in-scope instance finished the execution flow (or was ruled out with saved evidence) **and** every related CWE procedure was run or dated N/A.

## Tooling (PWN)

skills_recall capec → read references/CAPEC-<id>.md; then skills_recall cwe for each related CWE; pwn_eval / BurpSuite / TransparentBrowser / SAST as the surface requires

## Procedure

1. **Applicability gate.** Check prerequisites and skills below. If the target cannot satisfy them, record `CAPEC-288 N/A: <reason>` and stop.
2. **Instance inventory.** List every actor/path/API/host where this pattern can run (anonymous, low-priv, high-priv, adjacent network, local). One URL is not an inventory.
3. **Oracle.** From consequences, define pass/fail (auth bypass, data out, crash, persistence, etc.).
4. **Execute the flow.** Run every Explore → Experiment → Exploit step and every listed technique. Persist request/response, pcap, or debugger output under `/tmp` or the engagement dir and **re-read** it.
5. **Mutate.** Encoding, method, role, content-type, timing, second-order, chained related CAPECs. Do not stop at the first WAF 403.
6. **Mitigation negation.** For each mitigation, retry the flow with the control on and bypassed. Unchanged oracle = control failed.
7. **CWE close-out.** Open each related `cwe` skill file (`../cwe/references/CWE-<id>.md`) and run that exhaustive CWE procedure. CAPEC without CWE is a technique note, not a weakness finding.
8. **Report.** Cite `CAPEC-288`, related CWE IDs, instance, oracle, evidence path.

- [ ] Instance inventory is more than one guess
- [ ] Every execution-flow step was attempted or marked N/A
- [ ] Evidence artifact path saved and re-read
- [ ] Related CAPECs handled or deferred
- [ ] Related CWE procedures run via `cwe` skill
- [ ] Finding (if any) cites CAPEC-288 and CWE IDs
