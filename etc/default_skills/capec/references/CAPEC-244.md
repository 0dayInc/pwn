# CAPEC-244: XSS Targeting URI Placeholders

- Catalog: [CAPEC-244](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/244.html)
- Abstraction: Detailed · Status: Draft
- Likelihood of attack: High · Typical severity: High
- CAPEC list: 3.9

## Attack pattern

An attack of this type exploits the ability of most browsers to interpret "data", "javascript" or other URI schemes as client-side executable content placeholders. This attack consists of passing a malicious URI in an anchor tag HREF attribute or any other similar attributes in other HTML tags. Such malicious URI contains, for example, a base64 encoded HTML content with an embedded cross-site scripting payload. The attack is executed when the browser interprets the malicious content i.e., for example, when the victim clicks on the malicious link.

## Exhaustive test law

This is a detailed pattern. Execute every listed technique in the execution flow, then mutate encodings/roles/verbs. Also run the parent Standard/Meta patterns.

A scanner hit or a single blocked request is inventory, not a CAPEC-244 test. Complete means every in-scope instance finished the execution flow (or was ruled out with saved evidence) **and** every related CWE procedure was run or dated N/A.

## Tooling (PWN)

PWN::Plugins::BurpSuite, PWN::Plugins::TransparentBrowser, PWN::Plugins::Zaproxy

## Procedure

1. **Applicability gate.** Check prerequisites and skills below. If the target cannot satisfy them, record `CAPEC-244 N/A: <reason>` and stop.
2. **Instance inventory.** List every actor/path/API/host where this pattern can run (anonymous, low-priv, high-priv, adjacent network, local). One URL is not an inventory.
3. **Oracle.** From consequences, define pass/fail (auth bypass, data out, crash, persistence, etc.).
4. **Execute the flow.** Run every Explore → Experiment → Exploit step and every listed technique. Persist request/response, pcap, or debugger output under `/tmp` or the engagement dir and **re-read** it.
5. **Mutate.** Encoding, method, role, content-type, timing, second-order, chained related CAPECs. Do not stop at the first WAF 403.
6. **Mitigation negation.** For each mitigation, retry the flow with the control on and bypassed. Unchanged oracle = control failed.
7. **CWE close-out.** Open each related `cwe` skill file (`../cwe/references/CWE-<id>.md`) and run that exhaustive CWE procedure. CAPEC without CWE is a technique note, not a weakness finding.
8. **Report.** Cite `CAPEC-244`, related CWE IDs, instance, oracle, evidence path.

## Execution flow (minimum techniques)

- Step 1 (Explore): [Survey the application for user-controllable inputs] Using a browser or an automated tool, an adversary follows all public links and actions on a web site. They record all the links, the forms, the resources accessed and all other potential entry-points for the web application. | techniques: Use a spidering tool to follow and record all links. Make special note of any links tha…
- Step 2 (Experiment): [Probe identified potential entry points for reflected XSS vulnerability] The adversary uses the entry points gathered in the "Explore" phase as a target list and injects various payloads formatted as data URI schemes using base to determine if an entry point actually represents a vulnerability and to characterize the extent to which the vulnerability can be exploited. | tech…
- Step 3 (Experiment): [Craft malicious XSS URL] Once the adversary has determined which parameters are vulnerable to XSS, they will craft a malicious URL containing the XSS exploit. The adversary can have many goals, from stealing session IDs, cookies, credentials, and page content from the victim. | techniques: Change a URL parameter to include a malicious payload formatted as a URI scheme, or us…
- Step 4 (Exploit): [Get victim to click URL] In order for the attack to be successful, the victim needs to access the malicious URL. | techniques: Send a phishing email to the victim containing the malicious URL. This can be hidden in a hyperlink as to not show the full URL, which might draw suspicion.; Put the malicious URL on a public forum, where many victims might accidentally click the link.

## Prerequisites

- Target client software must allow scripting such as JavaScript and allows executable content delivered using a data URI scheme.

## Skills required

- Medium: To inject the malicious payload in a web page

## Resources required

- Ability to send HTTP request to a web application

## Oracles (consequences)

- Integrity: Modify Data
- Confidentiality: Read Data
- Authorization: Execute Unauthorized Commands — Run Arbitrary Code
- Accountability, Authentication, Authorization, Non-Repudiation: Gain Privileges
- Access Control, Authorization: Bypass Protection Mechanism

## Mitigations to bypass

- Design: Use browser technologies that do not allow client side scripting.
- Design: Utilize strict type, character, and encoding enforcement.
- Implementation: Ensure all content that is delivered to client is sanitized against an acceptable content specification.
- Implementation: Ensure all content coming from the client is using the same encoding; if not, the server-side application must canonicalize the data before applying any filtering.
- Implementation: Perform input validation for all remote content, including remote and user-generated content
- Implementation: Perform output validation for all remote content.
- Implementation: Disable scripting languages such as JavaScript in browser
- Implementation: Patching software. There are many attack vectors for XSS on the client side and the server side. Many vulnerabilities are fixed in service packs for browser, web servers, and plug in technologies, staying current on patch release that deal with XSS countermeasures mitigates this.

## Example instances (payload / topology hints)

- The following payload data: text/html;base64,PGh0bWw+PGJvZHk+PHNjcmlwdD52YXIgaW1nID0gbmV3IEltYWdlKCk7IGltZy5zcmMgPSAiaHR0cDovL2F0dGFja2VyLmNvbS9jb29raWVncmFiYmVyPyIrIGVuY29kZVVSSUNvbXBvbmVudChkb2N1bWVudC5jb29raWVzKTs8L3NjcmlwdD48L2JvZHk+PC9odG1sPg== represents a base64 encoded HTML and uses the data URI scheme to deliver it to the browser. The decoded payload is the following piece of HTML code:…

## Related CWEs (run the cwe skill)

- [CWE-83](../cwe/references/CWE-83.md) — run that CWE procedure after this CAPEC flow

## Verification

- [ ] Applicability recorded (in-scope or dated N/A)
- [ ] Instance inventory is more than one guess
- [ ] Every execution-flow step was attempted or marked N/A
- [ ] Evidence artifact path saved and re-read
- [ ] Related CAPECs handled or deferred
- [ ] Related CWE procedures run via `cwe` skill
- [ ] Finding (if any) cites CAPEC-244 and CWE IDs
