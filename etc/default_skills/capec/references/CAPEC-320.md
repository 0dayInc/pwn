# CAPEC-320: TCP Timestamp Probe

- Catalog: [CAPEC-320](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/320.html)
- Abstraction: Detailed · Status: Stable
- Likelihood of attack: Medium · Typical severity: Low
- CAPEC list: 3.9

## Attack pattern

This OS fingerprinting probe examines the remote server's implementation of TCP timestamps. Not all operating systems implement timestamps within the TCP header, but when timestamps are used then this provides the attacker with a means to guess the operating system of the target. The attacker begins by probing any active TCP service in order to get response which contains a TCP timestamp. Different Operating systems update the timestamp value using different intervals. This type of analysis is most accurate when multiple timestamp responses are received and then analyzed. TCP timestamps can be found in the TCP Options field of the TCP header.

## Exhaustive test law

This is a detailed pattern. Execute every listed technique in the execution flow, then mutate encodings/roles/verbs. Also run the parent Standard/Meta patterns.

A scanner hit or a single blocked request is inventory, not a CAPEC-320 test. Complete means every in-scope instance finished the execution flow (or was ruled out with saved evidence) **and** every related CWE procedure was run or dated N/A.

## Tooling (PWN)

skills_recall capec → read references/CAPEC-<id>.md; then skills_recall cwe for each related CWE; pwn_eval / BurpSuite / TransparentBrowser / SAST as the surface requires

## Procedure

1. **Applicability gate.** Check prerequisites and skills below. If the target cannot satisfy them, record `CAPEC-320 N/A: <reason>` and stop.
2. **Instance inventory.** List every actor/path/API/host where this pattern can run (anonymous, low-priv, high-priv, adjacent network, local). One URL is not an inventory.
3. **Oracle.** From consequences, define pass/fail (auth bypass, data out, crash, persistence, etc.).
4. **Execute the flow.** Run every Explore → Experiment → Exploit step and every listed technique. Persist request/response, pcap, or debugger output under `/tmp` or the engagement dir and **re-read** it.
5. **Mutate.** Encoding, method, role, content-type, timing, second-order, chained related CAPECs. Do not stop at the first WAF 403.
6. **Mitigation negation.** For each mitigation, retry the flow with the control on and bypassed. Unchanged oracle = control failed.
7. **CWE close-out.** Open each related `cwe` skill file (`../cwe/references/CWE-<id>.md`) and run that exhaustive CWE procedure. CAPEC without CWE is a technique note, not a weakness finding.
8. **Report.** Cite `CAPEC-320`, related CWE IDs, instance, oracle, evidence path.

## Execution flow (minimum techniques)

- Step 1 (Explore): [Determine if timestamps are present.] The adversary sends a probe packet to the remote host to identify if timestamps are present.
- Step 2 (Experiment): [Record and analyze timestamp values.] If the remote host is using timestamp, obtain several timestamps, analyze them and compare them to known values. | techniques: The adversary sends several requests and records the timestamp values.; The adversary analyzes the timestamp values and determines an average increments per second in the timestamps for the target.; The adversary…

## Prerequisites

- The ability to monitor and interact with network communications.Access to at least one host, and the privileges to interface with the network interface card.The target OS must support the TCP timestamp option in order to obtain a fingerprint.

## Skills required

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Resources required

- Any type of active probing that involves non-standard packet headers requires the use of raw sockets, which is not available on particular operating systems (Microsoft Windows XP SP 2, for example). Raw socket manipulation on Unix/Linux requires root privileges. A tool capable of sending and receiving packets from a remote system.

## Oracles (consequences)

- Confidentiality: Read Data
- Confidentiality, Access Control, Authorization: Bypass Protection Mechanism

## Mitigations to bypass

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Example instances (payload / topology hints)

- (none listed in CAPEC catalog)

## Related CAPECs (test these too)

- ChildOf → [CAPEC-312](CAPEC-312.md)

## Related CWEs (run the cwe skill)

- [CWE-200](../cwe/references/CWE-200.md) — run that CWE procedure after this CAPEC flow

## Verification

- [ ] Applicability recorded (in-scope or dated N/A)
- [ ] Instance inventory is more than one guess
- [ ] Every execution-flow step was attempted or marked N/A
- [ ] Evidence artifact path saved and re-read
- [ ] Related CAPECs handled or deferred
- [ ] Related CWE procedures run via `cwe` skill
- [ ] Finding (if any) cites CAPEC-320 and CWE IDs
